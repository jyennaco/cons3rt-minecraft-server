Prerequisites:

* python3 installed with selenium
* geckodriver installed for Selenium

Optional:

Seed your local with our project_info.json file:

mkdir -p ~/.minecraft
cp project_info.json ~/.minecraft

Usage:

1. Download a modpack from CurseForge (if it does not already have a server pack)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Run this command to download mods to the extracted mod directory

python3 mod_pack_maker.py build --mod /path/to/extracted/modpack

4. Zip up the *CONTENTS* of the modpack directory (don't zip the parent folder)
5. Attempt to run the server with the modpack, if any mod fails since it is "Client-Only", find it on your
computer in ~/.minecraft/project_info.json and set "client_mod" true.
